# People GitHub Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the People repository! This project is aimed at enhancing communication and accessibility for individuals with diverse needs. The People repository consists of four key features:

1. **RetinaVision**: An object detection system that utilizes computer vision to identify objects in the environment and provides information about them through voice communication.

2. **SigHnd**: A sign language detection tool that leverages camera input to interpret sign language gestures. SigHnd facilitates communication with individuals who use sign language as their primary means of expression.

3. **MuteTalk**: A text-to-voice generator designed to assist those who prefer or need to communicate through voice but may face challenges in doing so. MuteTalk converts text input into spoken words, enabling smooth conversations.

4. **SignAR**: A real-time text-to-AR generator that transforms typed text into augmented reality representations of sign language hands. SignAR enhances communication by providing a visual representation of sign language gestures corresponding to the entered text.

## Features
